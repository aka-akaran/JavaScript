// 1) compilation phase
// early error checking
// determining appropriate scope for variables


// 2) code execution phase
// JS code executes in the execution context
// first ec is globalEC

// Global Execution Phase
// 1) creation phase in global memory/ Memory Creation Phase
// 2) code execution phase
